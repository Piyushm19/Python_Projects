1.	I used Python to implement this Tokenization project. There are no dependencies needed to go thorugh my code, only Python is needed.

2.	My code doesn't need to be built, it can be run right when you enter the file.
 
3.	My file "P2.py" can be run if you run "python3 P2.py .2 .005" via command line. This is how you send in the values of lambda and tau into the file.
