1.	I used Python to implement this Evaluation project. There are no dependencies needed to go thorugh my code, only Python is needed.

2.	My code doesn't need to be built, it can be run right when you enter the file.
 
3.	My file "P5.py" can be run if you pull up the file on any python editor program.
